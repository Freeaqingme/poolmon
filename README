Poolmon is a director mailserver pool monitoring script for Dovecot, meant to
roughly duplicate the functionality of node health monitors on dedicated load-
balancers like Linux LVS or F5 BigIP hardware. This script can be safely run
on more than one director simultaneously, although differences in node 
reachability may result in mailserver weight flapping.

Consult the help text for more details on functionality.
